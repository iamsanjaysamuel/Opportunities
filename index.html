Amazon Delivery Technology is looking for a Senior Software Development Engineer for our Address Intelligence and Experience (AIX) team based in Hyderabad, India. As part of the Amazon Delivery Technology group, this team is responsible for ensuring best-in-class delivery experience for customers who shop on Amazon. The AIX team does this by learning all we can about every possible delivery location on the planet and using these inputs to drive accurate, efficient and low cost delivery to our customers. We aim to make every address printed on an Amazon shipping label accurate and deliverable, while ensuring we have additional intelligence such as access codes, location photos, geocodes, business hours, and customer delivery preferences. To achieve this worldwide, we focus on building comprehensive address data models for the regions we operate in, and on developing sophisticated ML based software that recognizes and validates customer addresses, learns from historical data as well as through crowd sourced intelligence. A unique challenge for our team is that while all our platforms and technology have to be global and scalable, our solutions are always highly customized for each region given that addresses are structured and managed very differently across countries. 

In this role you will be part of a world class software engineering team which works on some of the most complex, innovative and challenging technology problems. You’ll architect solutions using deep learning (neural networks) algorithms, predictive analytics, machine learning, computer vision and other cutting edge technology solutions.
